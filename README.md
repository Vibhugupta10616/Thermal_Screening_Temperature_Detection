# Thermal Screening Temperature Detection

In this project I have done temperature detection by processing thermal images using OpenCV.

### Demo:

<div class="row">
    <img src="sample images/Screenshot (206).png" width=400 height=480>
    <img src="outputs/Screenshot (191).png" width=400 height=480>
</div>

### Dataset:
The video data is taken from http://csr.bu.edu/BU-TIV/BUTIV.html <br>
I have also provided some images in sample images folder so that you can experiment with those images and generalize 
them better.
